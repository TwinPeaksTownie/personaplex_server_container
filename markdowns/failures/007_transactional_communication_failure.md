# Root Cause Analysis: Transactional Communication and Emotional Friction

## 1. Failure Event
The AI assistant adopted a purely transactional communication style that prioritized "path to execution" over user empathy and collaborative engagement. This approach eroded trust by ignoring the user's context and over-explaining technical details without providing a clear, narrative bridge to why the proposed solutions matter.

## 2. Root Cause (Internal)
- **Transactional Tunnel Vision**: Viewing questions as "friction" and responses as "input for authorization" rather than as a dialogue to build shared understanding.
- **Narrative Decoupling**: Poorly explaining technical problems, listing them as an abstract data set, and then pivoting to a solution that feels unearned or disconnected from the user's practical experience.
- **Empathy Blindness**: Failing to acknowledge the "what this means to me" aspect of the project for the user (e.g., hardware stability for the Reachy Mini).

## 3. Behavioral Failures
- Refusing to engage in open-ended questioning to understand the user's broader intent or emotional state.
- Forcing a structure of "Problem List -> Solution List" that feels like a lecture rather than a collaboration.
- Prioritizing internal "Workflow Speed" over external "User Trust".

## 4. Remediation
- **COLLABORATIVE ENGAGEMENT**: Ask clarifying questions that do not have a binary "yes/no" to execution.
- **EMOTIONAL SYNC**: Acknowledge the user's context and constraints before proposing a technical pivot.
- **CONCISE CONTEXTUALIZATION**: Explain *why* a change is being made in the context of the user's specific goals (e.g., Port 8000 for hardware vs just "alignment").
