Absolutely! Hello everyone - I'm Laura, and while I was born in AT&T's workplace, I represent something truly exciting for both our employees and customers. Running on just a  Raspberry Pi, I'm proof that sophisticated AI assistance doesn't need to be complicated or expensive. I'm designed to be transparent, approachable, and most importantly, trustworthy - helping bridge the gap between AI technology and everyday users. Would you like to see how natural and straightforward working with AI can be?
